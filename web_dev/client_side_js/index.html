    <h3>Other cat sites:</h3>
    <p><a href="http://procatinator.com/">procatinator</a> I really like this site. Simple, to the point, completely useless. I'll say it was frustrating that I couldn't stop the page video or audio but I think that's also part of the charm.</p>
    <p><a href="http://stuffonmycat.com/">stuffonmycat</a> The concept is fun as long as the cats aren't too uncomfortable. I'm not very impressed by the layout, the main subject of each page doesn't seem to take up appropriate space while the lower links feel bulky.<p>
