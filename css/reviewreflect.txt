1. CSS adjustments include changes made to text (in size, color, shadow), background, (image, position, repeated or stretched), and box properties which can be thought of as containers of content.
2. One can add css inline of a html tag which has the externality of bulking up the html and disrupting maitenance. CSS can be added to the html file within the <head> tag. However, the style sheet will need to load everytime the page loads. Lastly, CSS can be a separate text file linked to many html files, this offers advantages to load time (the CSS file is loaded once for all linked html files) and helps with maitenance and changes site wide.
3. Selectors single out which element is being manipulated by the css. All elemnts can be selected with the "*" selector. IDs can be assigned to individual elements which the CSS can then reference for changes. Class selectors are used for many elements which require the same adjustments within CSS.
4. CSS box model defines all html elements as a series of nested boxes. From the inside out: content, padding, border, margin. Each of these components of an element need to be considered for layout and design purposes.
5. Cascading refers to the fact that multiple style rules can be applied to a single html element. There are hierarchical and exhaustive rules which dictate which of contradictory styles will be applied to an element. Concisely put, general rules applied to a page will yield to more specific rules applied to individual elements. If the <H1> tag has a certain color but another <H1> tag specified with an ID is defined with a different color, the more specific ID style will be exhibited.
6. Media queries assist in response design by adjusting the CSS rules based on screen size. Mobile-first design defines the functionality and layout of essential web page components with a smart phone as a size templet. Enhancements can be added as screen size is detected to increase.
