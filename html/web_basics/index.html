  <H1> The Adventures of Shoo-Shoo and Y-Y! </H1>
  <p> Shoo-Shoo and Y-Y! were a couple of cats that got into trouble pretty much <strong>on the daily</strong>.  It's not that either of them <em>intended</em> to be such trouble makers.  You could say it was <em>in their nature</em>. </p>
  <h2> Some examples of troublesome behavior:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Knocking things off of counters (especially pens)</li>
    <li>Opening cupboards</li>
    <li>Rooting through cupboards</li>
    <li>Harassment of humans while sitting at computer</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Disciplinary actions and level of effectiveness</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Say name in loud voice.  Ineffective</li>
    <li>Squirt with water bottle.  Momentarily effective</li>
    <li>Put in spare room.  Effective with side effect of loud meowing</li>
  </ol>
